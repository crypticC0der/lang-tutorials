# lang-tutorials

a repo of small tutorials on various languages i use, but am not as familiar as i want to be<br>
i am going to do this for langauges as i need to, and i have  anumber of things i intend to add<br>

- cover C++ in depth
- cover a graphics library for C++, to do simple things such as a spinabble cube and a developing fractal
- cover javascript
- cover some tensorflow (i may skip covering python cos i know it well)
- **the thing that this leads up to, format all the documents to a specific so its easily searchable with commands such as**
<br>  `langhelp cpp math` -> displays subtopics of module math in file cpp or if there arent subtopics show the body of it
